pyamp
=====

`pyamp` is a command-line media player written in Python and uses Gstreamer as
the media backend. It began life as a holiday project for Paul Weaver, and the
name is either an homage to Winamp of old, or, more likely an acronym for
"Please, yet another media player?!".

To try it out, you'll need to install python-gstreamer and sqlite from your
repos, and then you can `pip install` pyamp.

Enjoy!
